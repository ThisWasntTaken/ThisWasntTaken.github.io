I am a 5th year student pursuing an Integrated Master of Technology degree in Computer Science at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology - Bangalore (IIIT-B)</a>.

My areas of interest are in the domain Data Science, specifically application of techniques in Machine Learning to problems in healthcare, privacy, and the natural sciences.

I am currently involved in a capstone project under the guidance of <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/t-k-srikanth">Prof. T K Srikanth</a> that aims to create a privacy-aware dynamic activity-based access control mechanism for sharing electronic health data in a distributed ecosystem.
