My research interests are in machine learning security. I am passionate about leveraging ML techniques to enhance cybersecurity measures against evolving threats. I am also interested in improving the robustness and interpretability of machine learning systems themselves, ensuring they remain reliable in the face of adversarial attacks and unforeseen challenges.
