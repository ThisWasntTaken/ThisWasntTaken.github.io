<ul>
<li>Open Set Recognition methods that accurately classify in-class (positive) samples and reject out-of-class samples.</li>
<li>Positive classes : bacteria, crystal, epithelial-cast, RBCs, RBC clumps, WBCs, WBC clumps, yeast.</li>
<li>All other images are considered to be artifacts and should be rejected.</li>
<li>Implementation of the technique <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06233">OpenMax</a> as an application to this dataset.</li>
<li>Created a novel approach that performed well on this dataset : classification of an artifact varies highly when its image is center-cropped with varying sizes. This distinguishes an artifact from a positive class sample as the latter is classified consistently into the same positive class.</li>
<li>Work included in a paper that has been accepted in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/med-neurips-2019">Medical Imaging meets NeurIPS 2019 Workshop</a>, 33rd conference NeurIPS 2019.</li>
